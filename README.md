## Multi-Object Tracking Example

### Overview
This MATLAB code is an example of multi-object tracking in a video sequence. The purpose of this code is to detect and track multiple moving objects in a video feed, assigning unique identifiers (IDs) to each object and predicting their locations across frames using the Kalman filter.

### Features
- Detects moving objects in a video sequence.
- Tracks multiple objects across frames.
- Predicts the locations of objects in subsequent frames.
- Assigns unique IDs to each tracked object.
- Handles occlusions and temporary object disappearances.
- Visualizes the tracking results in real-time.

### System Requirements
- MATLAB (R2018a or later)
- Computer Vision Toolbox

### Installation
1. Download and install MATLAB from the MathWorks website (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
2. Ensure that the Computer Vision Toolbox is installed. If not, install it using MATLAB Add-Ons.

### Usage
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into the MATLAB editor.
3. Save the file with a suitable name, e.g., `MultiObjectTrackingExample.m`.
4. Make sure your video file is in the MATLAB current directory or provide the correct path to the video file in the `VideoReader` object initialization.
5. Run the script.
6. The script will display two video players showing the original video and the detected objects with bounding boxes.

### Notes
- You may need to adjust parameters such as the number of training frames, minimum blob area, and Kalman filter settings based on your specific video sequence and tracking requirements.
- This example assumes that the video file is in a suitable format readable by MATLAB's `VideoReader` object.
